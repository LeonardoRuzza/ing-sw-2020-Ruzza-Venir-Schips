  1-Open "Program and Features" in the Control Center.
  2-Click on "Turn Windows features on or off".
  3-Check the Windows Subsystem for Linux option.
  4-Click the OK button.
  5-Click the Restart now button.
  6-Download "Ubuntu" from Microsoft Store and open it (or search for the Linux distribution that you want to install).
  7-Install Java from Ubuntu CLI.
  8-Exec the command "explorer.exe ." on the Ubuntu CLI.
  9-Copy or move Santorini-client.jar (which you have previously created) in this directory or where you prefer in subdirectory.
